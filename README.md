# Python Tools Repository

Welcome to the Python Tools repository, a collection of versatile and easy-to-use Python utilities designed to simplify and automate various tasks. The repository aims to provide a suite of tools that cater to a range of requirements, from decoding strings to potential future additions like data processing, file management, and more.

## 1. Encoded String Decoder

### Description
The Encoded String Decoder is a Python utility crafted to locate and decode strings that are encoded within a provided file. The tool peeks into the file, detects encoded strings following the specified formats, and decodes them, offering insights into potentially concealed or obfuscated data.

## 2. Caesar Cipher Decryption

### Description
The Caesar Cipher Decryption tool is designed to decrypt messages that have been encrypted using a Caesar cipher with a specific shift value. It provides a straightforward command-line interface to perform decryption for all possible shift values.

To use this tool, follow the instructions provided in the [Caesar Cipher Decryption README](caesar_decryption/README.md).

## 3. RC4 Cryptography

### Description
The RC4 Cryptography tool allows you to encrypt and decrypt messages using the RC4 (Rivest Cipher 4) stream cipher. It provides a simple command-line interface for encrypting and decrypting messages with a specified key.

To use this tool, follow the instructions provided in the [RC4 Cryptography README](rc4crypt/README.md).

# Future Tools
While the repository currently features the Encoded String Decoder, the Caesar Cipher Decryption tool, and the RC4 Cryptography tool, there's a roadmap to introduce more tools that cater to varied use-cases and necessities. Here are a few domains where new tools might emerge:

- Data Processing Utilities
- File Management Tools
- Network Communication Helpers
- Web Scraping and Automation Scripts
